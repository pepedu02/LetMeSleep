# Let Me Sleep Mod

A Godot-based mod made for the game Road to Vostok that allows the player to change the **time of day (TOD)** and **weather** by interacting with the sofa in the shelter.  
Automatically updates the game world settings and tooltip.

## üì¶ Features
- Change **time of day** in a 4-phase cycle.
- Randomly select weather with weighted chances.
- Automatically updates the **Settings UI** and saves preferences.
- Only works when the player is in a shelter (avoids hooking in wrong contexts).
- Optional debug logging for troubleshooting.
